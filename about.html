              I've always loved art. My first passion was drawing—capturing the
              gaze in people’s eyes as they looked at something beautiful, the
              relaxed placement of their hands, and the subtle curve of their
              mouths when someone they loved entered the room. I found joy in
              painting too, with its vibrant colors, landscapes, and
              cloudscapes. Photography, for me, became an extension of this
              love. It allows me to capture people in ways they might not see
              themselves.

              I began photographing brides because of my admiration for the
              timeless black-and-white portraits of my aunts and older
              sisters-in-law. A man can wear a tux anytime he wants, but a woman
              wears her wedding dress only once—on her wedding day. It’s a
              symbol of the wedding itself, and I love capturing the beauty and
              significance of that moment. With photography, I create visual
              stories—-unique paintings made of moments.

              I especially love when clients bring their own playfulness and
              creativity to a shoot. It’s a collaboration, an artistic
              partnership where we create together, capturing not just a pose
              but an experience, a feeling. Each picture is a window, revealing a
              special essence, a fleeting expression, or a connection. It’s a
              moment preserved, forever timeless. I cherish the opportunity to
              document people’s memories, telling their stories in ways that
              feel genuine and personal.<br><br>
