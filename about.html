          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            A photographer and graphic artist, I've always loved art. My first
            passion was drawing—capturing the gaze in people’s eyes as they
            looked at something beautiful, the relaxed placement of their hands,
            and the subtle curve of their mouths when someone they loved entered
            the room. I found joy in painting too, with its vibrant colors,
            landscapes, and cloudscapes. Photography, for me, became an
            extension of this love. It allows me to capture people in ways they
            might not see themselves.

            I began photographing brides because of my admiration for the
            timeless black-and-white portraits of my aunts and older
            sisters-in-law. A man can wear a tux anytime he wants, but a woman
            wears her wedding dress only once—on her wedding day. It’s a symbol
            of the wedding itself, and I love capturing the beauty and
            significance of that moment. With photography, I create visual
            stories—unique paintings made of moments.

            I especially love when clients bring their own playfulness and
            creativity to a shoot. It’s a collaboration, an artistic partnership
            where we create together, capturing not just a pose but an
            experience, a feeling. Each picture is a window, revealing a special
            essence, a fleeting expression, or a connection. It’s a moment
            preserved, forever timeless. I also offer ways to transform these moments into custom heirloom albums 
            or heartfelt greeting and thank you cards, tailored to celebrate and preserve your memories.
